# NeGrowTio: A Lending Management System For Public Market Vendors And The Community In San Jose Batangas

Introduction
  The digital revolution has compelled organizations to reevaluate their business strategies and invest in digital transformation. However, a common mistake is assuming that purchasing technology alone will lead to transformation. It is crucial to have the right processes, culture, and talent in place to effectively utilize technology. Without these elements, even the best technology will not yield desired results. When examining SME finance, it is important to consider the decision-making process that shapes their financial structures. While financing options and preferences change as small businesses evolve, existing approaches often fail to explain how these decisions are made. For female entrepreneurs, motivations such as creativity, innovation, self-identity, independence, and societal contribution drive their venture creation. However, their professional capabilities as entrepreneurs are often not fully recognized or acknowledged by society.

  Digital infrastructure and technology have become increasingly prominent and essential in a variety of industries. However, many market vendors, including lenders, still don't have access to such resources. Internet coverage may be inadequate or non-existent in some areas, particularly in rural ones. Additionally, some vendors may be unfamiliar with digital platforms and applications, which makes it difficult for them to embrace or use such technologies. Since market vendors and lenders have limited access to digital infrastructure and technology, they are unable to take advantage of the benefits that these advances in technology provide.

SDG
  The SDG which this project aims to attain is Decent Work and Economic Growth. Public vendors are often small business owners who face challenges in accessing capital to finance their businesses, which can limit their ability to grow and create jobs. In addition, the system can help promote decent work by enabling vendors to invest in their businesses, improve their working conditions, and increase their incomes. Furthermore, it can help promote financial inclusion by providing access to credit for those who may not have traditional banking relationships. This can help reduce poverty and support economic growth by enabling individuals and small businesses to participate more fully in the economy.
